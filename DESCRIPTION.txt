The main goal of the game is to collect pearls from shells
by swimming into them while at the same time increasing the
diver’s oxygen level by collecting air bubbles.
But, if the diver hits a fish then the oxygen goes down more quickly,
if he should be unlucky enough to swim into a shark,
it will go down drastically. To avoid fishes,
you can shoot them by aiming with the mouse and
clicking the left mouse button to shoot.

The keyboard arrows allow the player to jump or
dive and right arrow increases the divers swimming speed.
