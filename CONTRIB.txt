With the group being small this was a very collaborative approach
and both contributors had to multitask.
Both team members had to work on all of the game details
and as the process evolved the game was refined with contributions from both individuals. 

Inspiration: Leo came up with the Deep Ocean idea -
underwater adventure of a diver.
While doing a vector research Guoda found
the main menu image which was a main inspiration for design.


While implementing the main game physics,
Guoda suggested using flappy bird movements:
constantly use jump action so the diver would keep floating.

Leo improved the idea making it float up and down.
Leo even remixed the music himself (Yellow Submarine, Under the Sea).
